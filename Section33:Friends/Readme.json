The goal of this exercise is to practice the use of friendfunctions and classes in C++.

You will create two classes:

Point→ represent (x,y)

Circle→ represents a circle with a center ( Point) and a radius ( radius)

You must write a function

bool is_inside(const Circle& c, const Point& p);


that returns:

true      if the point is inside or on the circle,

false     if it's outside the circle.
